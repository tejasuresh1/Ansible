Ansible Overview
What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and IT orchestration. It allows users to define the desired state of systems and applications using simple, human-readable YAML files, making it easy to manage complex IT environments.

Key Features
Agentless Architecture: Ansible operates without requiring any software to be installed on the target nodes. It uses SSH for communication, making it lightweight and easy to set up.
Simple YAML Syntax: Configuration and automation tasks are written in YAML, a straightforward and human-readable language.
Idempotency: Ansible ensures that the system reaches the desired state without repeating the same tasks if they have already been completed.
Modularity: Ansible uses modules to perform specific tasks, such as installing packages, managing services, and handling files. Modules can be reused and shared.
Extensibility: Ansible can be extended using custom modules, plugins, and roles, allowing users to tailor the tool to their specific needs.
Strong Community Support: Ansible has a large and active community that contributes modules, roles, and best practices, making it a continually evolving tool.
Basic Concepts
Playbooks: Playbooks are Ansible's configuration, deployment, and orchestration language. They describe the desired state of systems in YAML format.
Tasks: Tasks are the building blocks of playbooks. Each task represents a single action to be performed on the managed nodes.
Roles: Roles are a way to organize playbooks into reusable components. They allow for the grouping of tasks, variables, files, templates, and handlers.
Inventory: The inventory is a list of managed nodes, defined in a file or dynamically generated. It specifies which hosts Ansible will manage.
Modules: Modules are the units of work in Ansible. Each module is a standalone script that Ansible executes on the managed nodes.
